# ðŸ§  Neuron

Neuron is a personal AI-enhanced note-taking app built to organize chaos. You dump raw thoughts, rants, todos, and Neuron classifies, tags, and gives you a birdâ€™s eye view of your mindâ€”ideas, goals.

Itâ€™s for people who think faster than they can type, and who need clarity without being nagged by "productivity" tools.

## ðŸ§© Features (in progress)

- Raw notes: you just write, dump, voice record, whatever.
- AI pass: classifies your entries (goals, rants, todos, ideas, dreams, pain).
- Search, tag, and filter by emotion or type.
- Optional: voice-to-text input, clipboard paste detection, quick-jot from browser.

## ðŸ”§ Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js + TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Next.js
- **AI Layer**: GPT-based classification & summary (custom tuned)
- **DB**: SQLite or Postgres (early phase, likely SQLite for dev)

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision

Think of it as a second brain. You donâ€™t need to organize everythingâ€”Neuron figures out what matters and gives it back to you in categories you actually care about.

## ðŸ¤– AI Use

You write one long chaotic note. AI breaks it into:

- âœ… Tasks
- ðŸ§  Ideas
- ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- ðŸ’¢ Rants
- ðŸ’¡ Epiphanies
- ðŸ“Œ Priorities

â€¦and more.

## ðŸ“¦ Status

Early prototyping. This README will evolve with the project.

README might be made by an AI but this project is a solo learning project.
