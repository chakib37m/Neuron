# ðŸ§  Neuron

Neuron is a personal AI-enhanced note-taking app built to organize chaos. You dump raw thoughts, rants, todos, and Neuron classifies, tags, and gives you a birdâ€™s eye view of your mindâ€”ideas, goals, problems, and bullshit all included.

This isnâ€™t Notion. Itâ€™s not pretty or bloated. Itâ€™s fast, local-first, and opinionated. Itâ€™s for people who think faster than they can type, and who need clarity without being nagged by "productivity" tools.

## ðŸ§© Features (in progress)

- Raw notes: you just write, dump, voice record, whatever.
- AI pass: classifies your entries (goals, rants, todos, ideas, dreams, pain).
- Search, tag, and filter by emotion or type.
- Optional: voice-to-text input, clipboard paste detection, quick-jot from browser.
- Dark mode mandatory.

## ðŸ”§ Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js + TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **AI Layer**: GPT-based classification & summary (custom tuned)
- **DB**: SQLite or Postgres (early phase, likely SQLite for dev)

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision

Think of it as a second brain that doesnâ€™t judge. You donâ€™t need to organize everythingâ€”Neuron figures out what matters and gives it back to you in categories you actually care about.

## ðŸ¤– AI Use

You write one long chaotic note. AI breaks it into:

- âœ… Tasks
- ðŸ§  Ideas
- ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- ðŸ’¢ Rants
- ðŸ’¡ Epiphanies
- ðŸ“Œ Priorities

â€¦and more.

## ðŸ“¦ Status

Early prototyping. This README will evolve with the project. No perfectionism, just shipping.

README might be made by an AI but this project is a solo learning project.





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
